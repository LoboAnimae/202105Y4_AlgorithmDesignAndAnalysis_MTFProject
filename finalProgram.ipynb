    "According to Wikipedia, an online algorithm can be thought of as what an interpreter for its own input. It can be thought of as what Python does, vs any kind of language that uses a compiler, since Python's code is not run until the program reaches a certain line. This contrasts against how a compiled program runs, since all code must be read and COMPILED before run-time. This means that the algorithm only has access to whatever happens to be pointed at, at any given point in time by the algorithm. Before and after do not exist, only the present value. As per [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm \"Online Problems\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is an interpreted language. If it were an algorithm, it would be online.\n",
    "    \n",
    "On the other side, an offline algorithm is the exact opposite. An offline algorithm is given ALL the data from the start, which means that the data must be available from BEFORE the algorithm starts. \n",
    "\n",
    "    C/C++ and other compiled languages need all the information about memory usage to work from the beginning. \n",
    "    If they were algorithms, they would be offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain cases, an online algorithm would be better, in others, not so much. By definition, the MTF algorithm is online, and the IMTF algorithm is offline. This is because MTF grabs a certain value, no matter what came before, or what comes after, and calculates the cost of such. On the other side, IMTF requires knowledge of what comes after the index that we're currently working on. This means that the data MUST be known to the algorithm, even if it is not working on it at the moment it is processing a different value. In the case of MTF becoming an offline algorithm, it would probably become IMTF, and viceversa. \n",

    "#### Insertion Sort\n",
    "Let us think of the Insertion Sort algorithm. This algorithm is a stable algorithm that can sort a list as it receives it, and it sorts by only seeing one item at a time. This algorithm is much less efficient on larger lists, but it has proven to be easy to implement. This can be seen in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort \"Insertion Sort\"). On the other side, an offline algorithm requires the list to be ever-present. In such cases, the list can be seen in a divide-and-conquer kind of sense, such as in a Quicksort algorithm. This algorithm requires to know different sections of the list to work. \n",
